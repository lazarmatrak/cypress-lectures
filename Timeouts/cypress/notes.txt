*** Cypress multi reporters ***
To install the cypress multi reporters paste npm install --save-dev cypress-multi-reporters mocha-junit-reporter into the project directory via terminal

*** Configure reporters ***
1. 
In cypress.config.js paste:
reporter: "cypress-multi-reporters",
    reporterOptions: {
      configFile: "reporter-config.json",
    }

This will tell Cypress which reporters to use via the "reporter" property and where their configuration will be located in the reporterOptions.configFile property

2. 
Create in the base folder a reporter-config.json file
Inside of it paste 
{
  "reporterEnabled": "spec, mocha-junit-reporter",
  "mochaJunitReporterReporterOptions": {
    "mochaFile": "cypress/results/junit/results-[hash].xml"
  }
}

This will enable the mocha-junit reporter to run the specs via "reporterEnabled"
And the "mochaJunitReporterReporterOptions" - "mochaFile" specifies where the results and in what format will they be output
